title:  "Melbourne Wildcard Speakers!"
---

For a while now, we've had a speaker's spot at the end of the day listed as "Wildcard".

This is because we had one speaker who's attendance we were not certain of. Due to
ambiguity and timing issues around how this spot would be filled, we decided to
defer the announcement until we were certain about who would be speaking.

We've now confirmed that the spot will be filled by Magdalena Cassel &amp; Aaron Edwards.
Their talk will be "Functional Eyes" - a look into the applications of functional-programming
principles in non-fp contexts.

<br />

Magdalena and Aaron both spent a year working in Clojure before moving on to
other projects in a variety of Object-Oriented languages.  By applying the
principles of functional programming in these other contexts, they were able to
write cleaner, more efficient, more testable code.  They will discuss the ways in
which their experience in FP has informed their design choices in other paradigms.

to find out where they lie in the day's line-up!
