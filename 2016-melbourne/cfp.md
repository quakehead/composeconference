* Easy Chair TODO Link
* Via Email TODO Link

## Feel

We want Compose Melbourne to be all about the community. We're aiming to
help foster the growth of Functional Programming in Melbourne and
unite all interested parties to spark a unified presence and a feeling
of camaraderie amongst FP and Theory proponents in this wonderful
city!


## Audience

Functional-Programming and Programming-Language-Theory professionals
and enthusiasts.  Newcomers, experts, anyone from other disciplines of
fields who is interested in what FP is or how it could help them with
their work, or simply make life more enjoyable!


## Diversity

Just like Compose-Conference, we would also like to put an emphasis on
soliciting a diverse set of speakers - anything you can do to distribute
information about this CFP and encourage submissions from under-represented
groups would be greatly appreciated.

We welcome *all* (new and established) contributions and encourage you to apply!


## Day One

## Suggested Topics

Topics for proposals for presentations are invited, but not limited to
explore the following topics:

### New Languages

The development of new and emerging Functional Languages, and the toolsets
around them.

### Libraries and Tools

Exploring the use and development of new and underrepresented tools and
libraries.

### Production Systems

2016 has seen many previously undeployed languages and systems break through
into production. We're looking for war-stories, success-stories and sob-stories!

### Theory

Theory is the cutting edge of new functional programming. Show the world
what is rising over the horizon.

### Art and Music

Exciting and innovative usage of functional programming language in the arts!

## Day Two

The second day will be dedicated to workshops and unconferences.

### Workshops

We will be running a beginners Haskell workshop.

If you wish to run a workshop on the second day of the conference, then
please let us know. Alternatively, if there is a workshop that would interest
you as an attendee, then please also let us know.

### Unconference

Got something random you want to talk about? The unconference will run
the second day. There will be a whiteboard with spaces where anyone
can write their name down to speak. There's no need to bring anything
but yourself and your ideas and speaking voice.

## Sponsors

We are seeking sponsors to support us in putting on this conference. If
you or your company would like to sponsor us, please get in contact via
[composemel-admin@googlegroups.com](mailto:composemel-admin@googlegroups.com).
